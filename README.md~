MyPaint
=======

An interface created in openGL to provide user similar functionality as that provided by ms-paint.

CONTENTS:
----------------------
1. This tar archive contains following files:
	a. pen_t.h & pen_t.cpp
	b. line_t.h & line_t.cpp
	c. fill_t.h & fill_t.cpp 
	d. color_t.h & color_t.cpp
	e. canvas_t.h & canvas_t.cpp
	f. drawing_t.h & drawing_t.cpp
	g. point_t.h & point_t.cpp
	h. polygon_t.h & polygon_t.cpp 
	i. main.cpp
	j. README
	k. finalRoomImage

HOW TO RUN:
------------------------
1. Extract the archive and change the directory into that folder.
2. Run the following command to compile the source files:
	"g++ -c *.h -lGL -lGLU -lglut"
	"g++  *.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o main"
3. This will create a binary named "main" in the current folder.
4. Run the binary using the command "./main"


INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------
1.There are three pen modes:
	1. line mode: use key '1' to activate this mode. 
	2. polygon mode: use key '2' to activate this mode. When you are done making the polygon, press '1', this will complete the polygon and activate the line mode.
	3. eraser mode
2. Rest implementation is same as that given in the problem statement. Follow the instructions given on the terminal when 	creating a keyboard event.
3. Save the drawing using the key 's' and give the file name on terminal. This will save the drawing in that file.
4. To load a file, open a new drawing i.e run the main binary, press load and give the file name on the terminal.


ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION:
---------------------------
1. We have implemented "UNDO" functionality in our program. The key to be pressed for undo is 'z'.
